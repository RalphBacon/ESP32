# ESP32

# For the demo sketch see https://www.youtube.com/RalphBacon video #95

Having used the ESP8266 recently I was impressed by its speed. When it's bigger brother, the ESP32-WROVER development board, arrived it seemed an ideal moment to check them all out, speed-wise, against each other even though it did seem like a foregone conclusion.

Using the ESP32 was a bit of an eye-opener, and I made it much more difficult for myself by using the excellent Eclipse IDE, but in native C++ mode, not in Arduino mode. so all the Arduino language commands I was used to were not available to me. No wonder it took me nearly a week just to get the on-board LED to blink!

Anyway I finally managed to get something running and the video shows all, with more tales of my experiences with the ESP32.

Here are some great links (some of these documents I've also uploaded to my GitHub repository in case they disappear).
